    "# Equilibrium Solver #\n",
    "The Equilibrium solver is designed to take a reaction network as input and solve for a correct equilibrium solution. It does this by writing the system as a system of equations. Solving these equations can give the expected concentrations of all species at Equilibrium.\n",

    "It is useful to have this capability because we want to compare the results of our simulations to equilibrium. This allows for the detection of traps and other interesting kinetic effects. "
